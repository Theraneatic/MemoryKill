# MemoryKill
MemoryKill is a small bit of malware that could also be used to stress test. It utilizes infinite loops to load web pages as fast as possible to stress memory and the CPU, as well as slowing down the machine. 

# Stopping MemoryKill
MemoryKill uses MemoryOverload.exe to complete its task. To stop this task without the killswitches, go to task manager > details > memoryoverload.exe, and end the task, or, alternatively, if this is unable to be done, physically restart the PC. With the killswitch version, press X, Y, and Z simultaneously to stop the program.
